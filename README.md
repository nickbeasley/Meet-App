# Meet_Up

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Key Features:

● Filter events by city.<br>
● Show/hide event details.<br>
● Specify number of events.<br>
● Use the app when offline.<br>
● Add an app shortcut to the home screen.<br>
● View a chart showing the number of upcoming events by city.<br>

## User Stories:

● As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.<br>
● As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event.<br>
● As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once.<br>
● Asauser,IwouldliketobeabletousetheappwhenofflinesothatIcanseetheeventsI viewed the last time I was online.<br>
● As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster.<br>
● As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.<br>

## Technical Requirements:

● The app must be a React application.<br>
● The app must be built using the TDD technique.<br>
● The app must use the Google Calendar API and OAuth2 authentication flow.<br>
● The app must use serverless functions (AWS lambda is preferred) for the authorization server instead of using a traditional server.<br>
● The app’s code must be hosted in a Git repository on GitHub.<br>
● The app must work on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera, as well
as on IE11.<br>
● The app must display well on all screen sizes (including mobile and tablet) widths of 1920px
and 320px.<br>
● The app must pass Lighthouse’s PWA checklist.<br>
● The app must work offline or in slow network conditions with the help of a service worker.<br>
● Users may be able to install the app on desktop and add the app to their home screen on
mobile.<br>
● The app must be deployed on GitHub Pages.<br>
● The API call must use React axios and async/await.<br>
● The app must implement an alert system using an OOP approach to show information to the
user.<br>
● The app must make use of data visualization (recharts preferred).<br>
● The app must be covered by tests with a coverage rate >= 90%.<br>
● The app must be monitored using an online monitoring tool.<br>
